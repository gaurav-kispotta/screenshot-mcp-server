# Screenshot MCP Server - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
A Media Control Protocol (MCP) server that captures screenshots of windows in macOS and provides them via a network interface. This tool will allow remote applications to request and receive screenshots of specific windows or the entire screen.

## Core Features

### 1. Screenshot Capture
- Capture full-screen screenshots
- Capture screenshots of specific windows by ID or title
- Capture screenshots of specific screen regions
- Support different image formats (PNG, JPEG, etc.)
- Support various image quality settings
- Support different scaling options

### 2. Window Management
- List all available windows
- Get window properties (position, size, title, process ID)
- Filter windows by application
- Get window hierarchy
- Track window focus changes

### 3. MCP Server Implementation
- Implement the MCP protocol for communication
- Support discovery of the service on local networks
- Provide authentication mechanisms
- Handle concurrent client connections
- Support websocket protocol for real-time updates

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Implement efficient screenshot capturing with minimal overhead
- Support compression to reduce network bandwidth
- Implement caching mechanisms
- Throttle requests to prevent system overload

### 5. Command Interface
- RESTful API for HTTP clients
- CLI for terminal usage
- Configuration file support

## Technical Requirements

### macOS Integration
- Use macOS native APIs (Quartz Window Services, Core Graphics)
- Handle Retina/HiDPI display scaling
- Support multiple monitors
- Handle permissions for screen recording

### Implementation Details
- Language: Swift or Objective-C for native macOS integration
- Network stack: Use NIO or GCDAsyncSocket
- Image processing: Core Graphics, CoreImage
- Configuration: Use property lists or JSON

## Milestones

### Phase 1: Core Screenshot Functionality
- Implement basic screen capture functionality
- Create window enumeration and identification
- Build basic CLI interface

### Phase 2: MCP Server Implementation
- Design and implement the MCP protocol
- Create server listener and handler
- Implement basic authentication

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Add support for different image formats and quality settings
- Implement window tracking and events
- Add support for regions and selective captures

### Phase 4: Optimization and Polish
- Performance optimization
- Error handling and recovery
- Documentation and examples

## Security Considerations
- Implement authentication to prevent unauthorized access
- Add encryption for data in transit
- Handle macOS screen recording permissions
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Log access and operations for auditing

## Future Enhancements
- Video capture capabilities
- Mouse and keyboard event capture
- Interactive remote control
- Cross-platform client libraries
- Integration with popular tools and frameworks
